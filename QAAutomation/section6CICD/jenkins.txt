Jenkins
Jenkins is a software that allows continuous integration. 
Jenkins will be installed on a server where the central build 
will take place. The following flowchart demonstrates a very 
simple workflow of how Jenkins works.

Along with Jenkins, sometimes, one might also see the association 
of Hudson. Hudson is a very popular open-source Java-based 
continuous integration tool developed by Sun Microsystems which 
was later acquired by Oracle. After the acquisition of Sun by 
Oracle, a fork was created from the Hudson source code, which 
brought about the introduction of Jenkins.

What is Continuous Integration?
Continuous Integration is a development practice that requires 
developers to integrate code into a shared repository at regular 
intervals. This concept was meant to remove the problem of 
finding later occurrence of issues in the build lifecycle. 
Continuous integration requires the developers to have frequent 
builds. The common practice is that whenever a code commit occurs, 
a build should be triggered.
