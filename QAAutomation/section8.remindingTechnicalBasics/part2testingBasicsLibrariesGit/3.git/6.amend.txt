Changing the last commit

git commit --amend
if you want to rewrite the last commit, or if you forgot to add something
to the staging area, you can use this command.

1. Only rewrite a commit
git commit --amend
then the editor will open and rewrite whatever you want

2. Adding or modifying some files
git add anyFiles
git commit --amend
then the editor will open and rewrite whatever you want

Note: if you don't wish to rewrite the message because you only forgot some
details, you can let the same message (your last commit) following the next
steps:
git add anyFiles (modifying certain files a little bit)
git commit --amend --no-edit
then the editor will NOT open and the last commit brings the last changes you desire
