git reset [<mode>] [<commit>]

<mode>
--soft
Does not touch the index file or the working tree at all (but resets the head to <commit>, 
just like all modes do). This leaves all your changed files "Changes to be committed", as 
git status would put it.

--mixed
Resets the index but not the working tree (i.e., the changed files are preserved but not 
marked for commit) and reports what has not been updated. This is the default action.

--hard
Resets the index and working tree. Any changes to tracked files in the working tree since 
commit> are discarded. Any untracked files or directories in the way of writing any tracked 
files are simply deleted.
