Instance
A class instance is an object-oriented programming (OOP) object created from a class. 
Each instance of a class shares a data layout but has its own memory allocation.	

Parameter and Argument
A parameter is a special kind of variable used in a function to refer to one of the 
pieces of data provided as input to the function. These pieces of data are the values 
of the arguments with which the function is going to be called/invoked.

Object
In object-oriented programming (OOP), objects are the basic entities that actually 
exists in the memory. Each object is based on a blueprint of attributes and behaviours
(variables and functions) defined as Class.	

Field
Fields, also known as attributes or variables, are used to store data within an 
object or class. They represent the characteristics or properties associated with 
an object.

Constructor
constructor is a special type of function called to create an object. It prepares 
the new object for use, often accepting arguments that the constructor uses to set 
required member variables.
