Testing	
The process consisting of all lifecycle activities, both static and dynamic, 
concerned with planning, preparation and evaluation of software products and 
related work products to determine that they satisfy specified requirements, 
to demonstrate that they are fit for purpose and to detect defects.

Defect (bug)	
A flaw in a component or system that can cause the component or system to fail 
to perform its required function, e.g. an incorrect statement or data definition. 
A defect, if encountered during execution, may cause a failure of the component 
or system.  

Requirement	
A condition or capability needed by a user to solve a problem or achieve an objective
that must be met or possessed by a system or system component to satisfy a contract, 
standard, specification, or other formally imposed document. [After IEEE 610]

Priority	
The level of (business) importance assigned to an item, e.g., defect.

Test Environment (Test Bed)	
An environment containing hardware, instrumentation, simulators, software tools, 
and other support elements needed to conduct a test. [IEEE 610]

Ticket (Incident, Issue, Work item)	An item of any type (defect, task etc.) reported
to defect-/task-tracking system.

Test case	
A test case is a set of actions performed on a system to determine if it satisfies 
software requirements and functions correctly.
A test case document includes test steps, test data, preconditions and the expected 
result that verify requirements.

Precondition	
Is a list of necessary preparatory actions (application settings, testing environment
settings) for execution on the current test case.

Validation	
Confirmation by examination and through provision of objective evidence that the 
requirements for a specific intended use or application have been fulfilled. [ISO 9000]

Build	
A development activity where a complete system is compiled and linked, so that a 
consistent system is available at any time including all latest changes.
